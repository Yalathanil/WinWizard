3. Install and Update 3rd Party Programs

4. Begin Windows updates (may have to do this manually)

5. Turn on/Run Windows Defender

8. Run through the Services section, and manually diable/enable services. !!UPDATE THE SCRIPT WITH ANY SERVICES THAT ARE BAD!!

9. Enable Auditing

10. If the script is fixed: Let it import the security settings. If not, manually go into Local Security Policy>Computer settings and
    right click on the security policy icon. Then select import, and import the .inf file that is in downloads in the folder WinWizard.
   
11. Do users, ether run through the script or se the MMC. RN the users section is shit so dont use it

12. Run through media files. I suugest that you log them first to try and find any hidden ones needed for forensic questions. 

13. Set up the firewall and other network security stuff

14. Flush that DNS

15. Run that netstat if you want

16. TCP isn't set up yet
